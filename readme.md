Media sorting tool to organize photos and videos from your camera in folders by year, month and day.

## How it works
The software will collect all files from the input directory and copy them to the output directory without changing the files content. It will only rename the files and place them in the proper directory for year, month and day.

All files which are not images or videos or those which do not have creation date information will be placed in a directory called `unknown` without file name change. By doing this you can be sure that the input directory can be safely deleted after the successful process completion because **all** files from the input directory have a copy in the output directory.

## Installation
### Linux (snap)
Requires [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install)
```
sudo snap install phockup
```
*Note: snap applications can access files only in your **home and `/media` directories** for security reasons. If your media files are not located in these directories you should use the installation method below.  
If your files are in `/media` you should run the following command to allow access:*
```
sudo snap connect phockup:removable-media
```

### Linux (without snap)
If you are using distro which doesn't support [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install) or you don't want to download the snap you can use the following commands to download the source and set it up
```
sudo apt-get install python3 libimage-exiftool-perl -y
curl -L https://github.com/ivandokov/phockup/archive/latest.tar.gz -o phockup.tar.gz
tar -zxf phockup.tar.gz
sudo mv phockup-* /opt/phockup
sudo ln -s /opt/phockup/phockup.py /usr/local/bin/phockup
```

### Mac
Requires [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
```
brew tap ivandokov/homebrew-contrib
brew install phockup
```

### Windows
* Download and install latest stable [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
* Download Phockup's [latest release](https://github.com/ivandokov/phockup/archive/latest.tar.gz) and extract the archive
* Download exiftool from the official [website](https://exiftool.org/) and extract the archive
* Rename `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`
* Move `exiftool.exe` to phockup folder
* Open Command Prompt and `cd` to phockup folder
* Use the command below (use `phockup.py` instead of `phockup`)

### Docker
```
docker run -v ~/Pictures:/mnt ivandokov/phockup:latest phockup /mnt/Input /mnt/Output [PHOCKUP ARGUMENTS]
```

The `-v ~/Pictures:/mnt` part of the command mounts your `~/Pictures` directory to `/mnt` inside the container. You can pass any **absolute** path to be mounted to the container and later on be used as paths for the `phockup` command. The example above provides your `~/Pictures/Input` as `INPUTDIR` and `~/Pictures/Output` as `OUTPUDIR`. You can pass additional arguments afterwards.

## Usage
Organize photos from one directory into another
```
phockup INPUTDIR OUTPUTDIR
```

`INPUTDIR` is the directory where your photos are located.
`OUTPUTDIR` is the directory where your **sorted** photos will be stored. It could be a new not existing directory.

Example:
```
phockup ~/Pictures/camera ~/Pictures/sorted
```

### Version
If you want to view the version of phockup use the flag `-v | --version`.

### Date format
If you want to change the output directories date format you can do it by passing the format as `-d | --date` argument.
You can choose different year format (e.g. 17 instead of 2017) or decide
        to skip the day directories and have all photos sorted in year/month.

```
Supported formats:
    YYYY - 2016, 2017 ...
    YY   - 16, 17 ...
    MM   - 07, 08, 09 ...
    M    - July, August, September ...
    m    - Jul, Aug, Sept ...
    DD   - 27, 28, 29 ... (day of month)
    DDD  - 123, 158, 365 ... (day of year)

Example:
    YYYY/MM/DD -> 2011/07/17
    YYYY/M/DD  -> 2011/July/17
    YYYY/m/DD  -> 2011/Jul/17
    YY/m-DD    -> 11/Jul-17
```

### Missing date information in EXIF
If any of the photos does not have date information you can use the `-r | --regex` option to specify date format for date extraction from filenames:
```
--regex="(?P<day>\d{2})\.(?P<month>\d{2})\.(?P<year>\d{4})[_-]?(?P<hour>\d{2})\.(?P<minute>\d{2})\.(?P<second>\d{2})"
```

As a last resort, specify the `-t | --timestamp` option to use the file modification timestamp. This may not be accurate in all cases but can provide some kind of date if you'd rather it not go into the `unknown` folder. 

### Move files
Instead of copying the process will move all files from the INPUTDIR to the OUTPUTDIR by using the flag `-m | --move`. This is useful when working with a big collection of files and the remaining free space is not enough to make a copy of the INPUTDIR.

### Link files
Instead of copying the process will create hard link all files from the INPUTDIR into new structure in OUTPUTDIR by using the flag `-l | --link`. This is useful when working with good structure of photos in INPUTDIR (like folders per device).

### Original filenames
Organize the files in selected format or using the default year/month/day format but keep original filenames by using the flag `-o | --original-names`.

### File Type
By default, Phockup addresses both image and video files. If you want to restrict your command to either images or videos only, use `--file-type=[image|video]`. 

### Fix incorrect dates
If date extracted from photos is incorrect, you can use the `-f | --date-field` option to set the correct exif field to get date information from. Use this command to list which fields are available for a file:
```
exiftool -time:all -mimetype -j file.jpg
```
The output may look like this, but with more fields:
```
[{
  "DateTimeOriginal": "2017:10:06 01:01:01",
  "CreateDate": "2017:01:01 01:01:01",
]}
```
If the correct date is in `DateTimeOriginal`, you can include the option `--date-field=DateTimeOriginal` to get date information from it.
To set multiple fields to be tried in order until a valid date is found, just join them with spaces in a quoted string like `"CreateDate FileModifyDate"`.

### Dry run
If you want phockup to run without any changes (don't copy/move any files) but just show which changes would be done, enable this feature by using the flag `-y | --dry-run`.

### Log
If you want phockup to run and store the output in a log file use the flag `--log`. This flag can be used in conjunction with the flag `-q | --quiet`.
```
--log=<PATH>/log.txt
```

### Quiet run
If you want phockup to run without any output (displaying only error messages, and muting all progress messages) use the flag `-q | --quiet`.

### Limit directory traversal depth
If you would like to limit how deep the directories are traversed, you can use the `--maxdepth` option to specify the maximum number of levels below the input directory to process.  In order to process only the input directory, you can disable sub-directory processing with:
`--maxdepth=0`  The current implementation is limited to a maximum depth of 255.

### Style Guide Ruleset
Please make sure that the code is compliant as described below when committing a feature or improvement.

#### Flake8
We use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to check the PEP 8 ruleset.

Code style for the line length are following the description of the tool [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html#line-length)
In a nutshell, this comes down to to 88 characters per line. This number was found to produce significantly shorter files.

#### isort
We also use [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort to check if import are sorted alphabetically, separated into sections and by type.

##### single-quotes and double-quotes 
We try to adhere to the following as much as possible:
Use single-quotes for string literals, e.g. 'my-identifier', but use double-quotes for strings that are likely to contain single-quote characters as part of the string itself (such as error messages, or any strings containing natural language), e.g. "You've got an error!".

Single-quotes are easier to read and to type, but if a string contains single-quote characters then double-quotes are better than escaping the single-quote characters or wrapping the string in double single-quotes.
